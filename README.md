RESEARCH PROJECT
-----------------------------

We have also done a research project

GitHub Link: https://github.com/debroglie27/ChatApp

Implemented 2 Research Papers and 1 Article
- [Design of Hybrid Cryptography System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9199997)
- [An Extended Version of the Polybius Cipher](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=35f5b5360154090df72c48fa7e290b807dbef113)
- [SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html)


The implementation is shown using a simple Chat Application
- For end-to-end encryption hybrid cryptography and extended polybius cipher are used.
- For end-to-end integrity check SHA-256 is used.
- We also showed demo of Man-In-The-Middle attack.
